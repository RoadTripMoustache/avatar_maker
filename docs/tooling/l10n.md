# l10n - Localization

Localization is use to allow applications any languages to be able to easily implement the library without defining themselves all the titles for each category.

## Supported languages
Currently the following languages are supported :
- English
- French

## How to use it ?
### 1. Update arb files
First, you need to add the new labels or title to display in the `localization/xx.arb` files.

The name of the new label must be enough detailed to understand its purpose without any additional documentation. But adding some documentation to provide more details is always appreciated.

### 2. Generate the new `app_localizations.dart` files
Run the following command to generate again the `src/l10n/app_localizations_xx.dart` files with your new labels.

```shell
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Use the new labels
From the `AppLocalizations l10n` instance declared in the [AvatarMakerController], you can get your new label by calling its getter.

*Example*

```
l10n.property_category_accessories
```
